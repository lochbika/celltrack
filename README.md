# celltrack
celltrack is software that finds continuous cells in 2D fields and tracks them
in time.

Branch v.01 can be considered as a first usable version with missing value support, a simple iterative advection correction and mainstream detection for splitting/merging tracks.

See doc/celltrack_doc.pdf for installing and usage infos.

You will need the cdi library to compile and run celltrack: https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdi/wiki

This software comes with absolutely no warranty! It is still under development!
